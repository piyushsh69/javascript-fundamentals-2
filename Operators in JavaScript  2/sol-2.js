/*
In JavaScript, the comma operator, is used to combine multiple expressions into a single expression.It evaluates each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost operand.While it's not commonly used in everyday JavaScript code, it can be handy in certain situations where multiple expressions need to be combined into a single statement.
*/

// Example -

    let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
    // The comma operator is used to combine expressions
    (a++, b++, c++);
    console.log(a, b, c);
